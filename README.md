# What GPT-3 says I should do

If you're looking to develop a match 3 game, there are a few key things you'll need to keep in mind. First, you'll want to make sure the gameplay is fun and engaging. This can be achieved by creating interesting level designs, adding power-ups and special items, and incorporating a variety of different game modes.

Next, you'll want to focus on creating a compelling visual design for your game. This can include choosing colors and graphics that are visually appealing and easy to differentiate, as well as animating the game pieces in a way that is smooth and engaging.

You'll also want to make sure your game is balanced and fair. This means ensuring that the game is neither too easy nor too difficult, and that all game elements are evenly balanced so that no one item or strategy is overpowered.

Finally, you'll want to consider adding features that will keep players coming back to your game. This can include things like daily challenges, leaderboards, and unlockable content. By incorporating these elements, you can create a game that is both fun and addictive for players.

# play-with-coroutines

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and an `ApplicationAdapter` extension that draws libGDX logo.

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](http://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `lwjgl3:jar`: builds application's runnable jar, which can be found at `lwjgl3/build/libs`.
- `lwjgl3:run`: starts the application.
- `test`: runs unit tests (if any).

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `core:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `core` project.
